/**

 * handle text in a given character encoding only (e.g. UTF-8); using this 
 * filter explicit setting of the character encoding in each component can 
 * then be avoided.
 * </p>
 * <p>Note that in order to avoid interference (as much as possible) with other
 * components in the HTTP processing pipeline, this filter delays the setting of
 * the character encoding until the very last moment it is possible to do it. 
 * (According to the servlet spec, this is just before request parameters
 * are read or the request body is read.) In fact, a request handler downstream 
 * may make a decision as to what encoding to use based on the absence of the 
 * character encoding, which is why this filter holds off setting it.
