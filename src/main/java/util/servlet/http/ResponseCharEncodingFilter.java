 * handle text in a given character encoding only (e.g. UTF-8); using this 
 * filter explicit setting of the character encoding in each component can 
 * then be avoided.
 * </p>
 * <p>Note that in order to avoid interference (as much as possible) with other
 * components in the HTTP processing pipeline, this filter delays the setting of
 * the character encoding until the very last moment it is possible to do it. 
 * (According to the servlet spec, it is just before the response body is 
 * written.) In fact, a response producer downstream may make a decision as to
 * what encoding to use based on the absence of the character encoding, which 
 * is why this filter holds off setting it.
