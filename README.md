Sneakily imports image goodies into OMERO without paying MRI session duties.


Idea
----
TODO: still clueless :-)


Build & Run...for the loo
-------------------------
Build and test everything:

    ./gradlew build

Use `gradlew <task>` (Unix; `gradlew.bat` for Windows) for finer control over
building, testing, etc. This lists all available build tasks:

    ./gradlew tasks

To run the app just follow the instructions TODO :-)


Tricksy Eclipsie
----------------
Using Eclipse? You can generate all project files with:

    ./gradlew eclipse

then just import the project into Eclipse; alternatively if you have the Gradle 
Eclipse plugin (Buildship), you could instead run: 

    ./gradlew build
 
then import into Eclipse as a Gradle project.
