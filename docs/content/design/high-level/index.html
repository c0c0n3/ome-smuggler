<h2 id="conceptual-overview">Conceptual Overview</h2>
<p>You can think of Smuggler as…[wada, wada, wada][TODO: a para on tech stack] [Late night silly thought: Java, having become the bastion of [abject-oriented programming] (http://typicalprogrammer.com/abject-oriented/), is now poised to be the sanctuary of dysfunctional programming. ]</p>

<p>The note at the bottom of the diagram tells you how the conceptual components map to Java packages. You can find a lot more about source code breakdown and dependencies in the next section. But before we dive deep into the source, a word of caution: the tech sauce is quite heavy to digest so it may be too much to gulp down in just one go if you’re not already pretty familiar with all the various techs we use. (It proved definitely too much for me, I tell you my tummy wasn’t a happy camper for days afterwards!) In that case, it’s probably best to take it slowly and skill up a bit before hand (as I did myself!), especially on Java 8 (dys-)functional programming and streams API.</p>
<div class="side-note">
<h6 id="springdoh">Spring…D’oh!</h6>
<p>Before starting developing Smuggler, we built a prototype app to learn about and experiment with the various (many!) bits and pieces that make up our current technology stack. Aptly named “Spring…D’oh”, this initial prototype has basically no app logic but pretty much the same architecture and exactly the same technology stack as Smuggler; we actually used its source base as a blueprint for Smuggler’s. If you’re not familiar with Java 8, Spring, Messaging, and all the other techs in Smuggler, “Spring…D’oh” may be a good starting point to get to grips with all this madness as it should be easier to see how the pieces of the puzzle all fall into place. At least it helped me… You can find the <a href="https://github.com/c0c0n3/spring-doh" title="Spring D'oh Project on GitHub">project on GitHub</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="codebase-essentials">Codebase Essentials</h2>
<p>The source base is split into two root packages: <code>ome.smuggler</code>, containing the app itself, and <code>util</code>, a general-purpose library with code that is totally independent of Smuggler and reusable across projects. In fact, <code>util</code> is part of the dowry we got when we forked from <a href="https://github.com/c0c0n3/spring-doh" title="Spring D'oh Project on GitHub">Spring D’oh</a>. Since then we added a few more <code>util</code> classes but we can potentially ditch the whole lot if there’s a better alternative. In any case, if you realise some of the code you’re writing for Smuggler can be generalised to make it reusable in other projects, well, then you know where to put it :-)</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s have a closer look at what’s in <code>ome.smuggler</code>. As noted in the diagram above, this is how Smuggler’s components map to actual Java code:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>REST controllers</em> are in the <code>web</code> package;</li>
<li>the <em>services</em> are in <code>core.service</code>;</li>
<li>the <em>messaging</em> functionality is split between <code>q</code> and <code>core.mgs</code>;</li>
<li>whereas we keep all <em>config</em> in, well you guessed it, <code>config</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few more words about messaging. The split mentioned above is between the abstract definition of the messaging functionality we need (what goes in <code>core.msg</code>) and the actual implementation in terms of a specific message oriented middleware, HornetQ at the moment, that sits in <code>q</code>. The idea is that Smuggler should only play the messaging game as defined in <code>core.msg</code> without caring about the actual implementation in <code>q</code>. Accordingly, the only code that depends on <code>q</code> is that in <code>config</code> as it needs to tie the interfaces in <code>core.msg</code> to the actual implementations in <code>q</code> and make them available through Spring. To keep our sanity, we decided to do away with both JMS and Spring’s own flavour of it: the code in <code>q</code> piggybacks directly on the HornetQ core API to implement the various interfaces defined in <code>core.msg</code>. Besides these interfaces, <code>core.msg</code></p>
