OME Util
========
This component is a general-purpose library whose code is totally independent
of Smuggler and reusable across projects. In fact, this is part of the dowry
we got when we forked from Spring D’oh. Since then we added a few more classes
but we can potentially ditch the whole lot if there’s a better alternative.
(I ended up writing this stuff myself as I went along because my Google
searches for better options failed me.)

In any case, if you realise some of the code you’re writing for Smuggler can
be generalised to make it reusable in other projects, well, now you know where
to put it :-)
