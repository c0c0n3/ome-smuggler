/* NOTE. Lock striping.
 * It'd be simpler to use one lock for all operations---put, modify, and remove.
 * But that would also be a bottleneck! Because each key corresponds to a
 * separate file, we could in principle use a separate lock for each key, so
 * for example modify(k1, ...) and modify(k1, ...) would use the same lock l1
 * and be serialised, but modify(k2, ...) would use a different lock l2 and
 * run in parallel w/r/t e.g. modify(k1, ...).
 *
 * Now, a naive implementation using a map { key -> lock } won't do as we'd
 * end up with one gazillion locks in the map overtime and removing locks from
 * the map while maintaining thread-safety is not trivial. Think of this as an
 * example:
 *   1. Thread t1 wants to perform an operation for key k. There's no lock in
 *      the map m for k so we create one m[k] = l1.
 *   2. Thread t2 comes along to perform another operation for the same key k,
 *      so it gets a reference to l1.
 *   3. t1 acquires l1 and t2 waits on t1 to release l1.
 *   4. t1 releases l1 and removes it from m.
 *   5. t2 acquires l1 and starts the operation, but is suspended before the
 *      operation completes.
 *   6. Another thread t3 kicks in to do an operation still with key k, but
 *      there's no lock in m for k, so we create one m[k] = l2 and this is
 *      what t2 gets.
 *   7. t2 and t3 now have different locks so their operations can run in
 *      parallel (on a multi-core box) but we wanted to serialise operations
 *      for the same key k!
 *
 * What about removing the lock from the map only when there are no threads
 * blocked on it? According to the JDK API docs, there's no reliable way to
 * tell how many threads are waiting on a lock, so we'd have to roll out our
 * own counting mechanism, and that should also take reentrancy into account,
 * and it should also...ya, the list goes on.
 *
 * Lock striping is instead easy enough to roll out and use. The invariant we
 * enforce is simply that
 *
 *    k1, k2 keys, L(k) lock associated to key k
 *
 *    k1 = k2   ==>  L(k1) = L(k2)
 *
 * so that operations for the same key will get the same lock and will be
 * serialised. But we can't ensure different keys will always get a separate
 * lock---i.e. potentially less parallelism, but that's unlikely for a good
 * choice of hashing and number of stripes. On the other hand we have a bounded
 * number of locks and no need to synchronise the retrieval of a lock---which
 * we'd have to do in the above scenario, i.e. less parallelism.
